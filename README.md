# Blog Backend
## Written in Go and Next JS
This is the backend code for my personal blog. The API is written in Go and the front-end is Next and TypeScript.

## Custom CMS
Instead of using a CMS (like Primsic or Sanity), I decided to build my own admin backend to create, edit, and delete posts. I'm using MongoDB to store the blog posts and a custom built GraphQL API to send posts to the front-end.
